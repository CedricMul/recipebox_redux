# recipebox_redux

This is an edit of a project created by my classmate, Cedric. New additions: the ability to edit recipes -- though limited to only admins and the author of the recipe being edited. Also, a way to mark recipes as "favorites."

COMING SOON -- A way to add recipes to a list of "favorites." Each recipe will have a "favorite" button, visible only to logged in users.

From the author detail page, a link will be available taking the user to a list of their favorites. Every user will have a collection of favorites.

The purpose of this branch is to make these updates without changing the original code or functionality unnecessarily. The only changes I made were related to those new features, with these minor exceptions:

1. a .gitignore file was created to speed up the process of pushing updates to GitHub.
2. The link to individual recipes was corrected to allow for easier testing of the new features.
3. Links to homepage were added to make testing easier. 
4. A display of the logged in user's name was created, again to make testing easier.
5. I added text to this README.


I may delete some of these changes before submitting the assignment.
